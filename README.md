# PythonGames

## connect4

This is a project to create the classic Connect 4 game. The main libraries used are pygame and numpy.

## minesweeper

This is a CLI minesweeper project. There are further improvements that could be made with the game, including making a proper GUI, but the functionality is there as of now. This is a good reference for nested loops.
