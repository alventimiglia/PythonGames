# PythonGames

## connect4

This is a project to create the classic Connect 4 game. The main libraries used are pygame and numpy.

## minesweeper

This is a CLI minesweeper project. There are further improvements that could be made with the game, including making a proper GUI, but the functionality is there as of now. This is a good reference for nested loops.

## pong

This is a recreation of the classic game, Pong. It uses the basic principles of Python, but really explores the use of the turtle library.

## snake

This is a recreation of Snake. I was interested in following the tutorial to complete this project because it used the tkinter and pygame libraries. It was also helpful to work through a breakdown in the math to make this game work.

## tetris

This is a recreation of Tetris. Making this game helped me understand the pygame library a bit better as well as drill how to make a big problem into much smaller parts. This is a good reference for a grid design that has moving parts.
