## minesweeper

This is a CLI minesweeper project. There are further improvements that could be made with the game, including making a proper GUI, but the functionality is there as of now. This is a good reference for nested loops.

## pong

This is a recreation of the classic game, Pong. It uses the basic principles of Python, but really explores the use of the turtle library.
